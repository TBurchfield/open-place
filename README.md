# open/place

The open-source tool for crowd-sourced drawing

open/place exists to resurrect one of Reddit's infamous social experiments:
r/place. The hope is to create a system that is:
1. Similar in UX to r/place
2. Somewhat configurable on the backend to see how users react in different
situations
